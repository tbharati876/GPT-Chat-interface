# NoBrokerage.com — AI Chat Property Finder

An intelligent **chat-based property discovery system** built as part of the **AI Engineer Intern Task** for **NoBrokerage.com**.  
The chatbot understands **natural language queries** like:

> "3BHK flat in Pune under ₹1.2 Cr"

and responds with:
- A short **summary** of results based on real project data (from CSVs)
- A list of **relevant property cards** with name, city, BHK, price, and status

---

##  Objective

To build a simple, GPT-like chat interface that helps users discover real-estate projects from structured CSV data, **without hardcoded filters or external APIs**.

---

##  Features

 **Natural Query Parsing** — Extracts city, BHK, and budget using regex  
 **CSV-based Search** — Reads property data from CSV files only  
 **Auto-generated Summaries** — Data-grounded text, no hallucinations  
 **Streamlit Chat Interface** — Simple, responsive chat UI  
 **Deployable from Google Colab or Streamlit Cloud** — No API tokens required
